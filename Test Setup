This project implements a simple number comparison game using TCP sockets and a graphical interface built with Tkinter.

🖥 Server (server_gui.py)
The server waits for two clients to connect.

Once connected, it receives a number (0–9) from each client.

The server then applies the game logic:

If the numbers are equal, it's a draw (2).

If the numbers differ by 3 or less, the higher number wins.

If they differ by 4 or more, the lower number wins.

The server sends the result (0, 1, or 2) back to each client.

The GUI includes a start button and a scroll window that logs server messages like connections and game results.

🧑‍💻 Client (client_gui.py)
The user enters a number between 0 and 9 and clicks "Send".

The client connects to the server via TCP and sends the number.

It then waits for a response:

1 → "You win!"

0 → "You lose!"

2 → "Draw!"

The result is displayed in a label below the button.

Two clients must be run separately to simulate the game between players.

🧪 Test Setup
Open 3 terminal windows:

Run server_gui.py to launch the server.

Run two instances of client_gui.py.

Each client sends a number to the server.

The server logs connections and results.
